# Multi-Digit-Classification
A repository containing programming files aimed at classification of handwritten digits using machine learning in Python

The code in this repository is based on the work I completed while enrolled in Andrew Ng's Coursera course on neural networks
and random forests in machine learning title "Advanced Learning Algorithms".
